## Churn_modelling

## Introduction
A churn model is a mathematical illustration of the effects of churn on our company. Churn estimations are constructed using historical data (the number of customers who left your service during a given time period). The data is trained by a predictive churn model to show potential churn rates in the future.
# Objective
Making a predictive model that calculates churn of a customer, the likelihood that a customer will stop doing business with the company using Artificial neural network

# Steps Involved
Importing dataset

check for null values

encoding categorical variables
splitting data into train set and test set
Feature scaling
Building ANN model
Initializing ANN model
Adding the input layer and the first hidden layer
Adding second hidden layer
Adding output layer
Training ANN
Predicting results
Making confusion matrix
